Changelog
=========

0.2.1
-----

* Progress tracking now works properly in Celery 3.X. Progress tracking
  previously worked in 2.5, but because we relied on behavior that changed in
  3.X to retrieve the task_id for recording the progress, it failed there.
  We've not only fixed that problem (with a test), but also moved to using the
  cleaner `self.update_state` call instead of a `self.backend.store_result`
  call. Thanks to George Marshall for help on the fix.

0.2.0
-----

* We're now overriding the base `Task.async_result` call, instead of the
  `Task.delay` call. This means that if you need to customize some of the
  options only available via `async_result`, you don't lose any of the
  Jobtastic functionality.
* `delay_or_fail` should now consistently detect all types of broker failures,
  regardless of your broker choice.
* `delay_or_eager` is here to replace `delay_or_run`! This applies your tasks
  the same way that Celery does when `CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER` is configured,
  giving you more consistency. The biggest benefit, though, is that you always
  get a result that behaves like an `AsyncResult` object, meaning you don't
  have to fuss with the `was_fallback` variable. `delay_or_run` is still
  around, but it's deprecated. It will go away with the `0.3.0` release.
* Bug fix: `delay_or_fail` actually works during the failure case, now.
  And we have tests on it so that it will keep working.
* `delay_or_fail` now properly sets the traceback for inspection via
  `get_traceback`.

Backwards Incompatible Changes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ``delay_or_FOO`` methods are now proper class methods. Previously, they
were special snowflakes and different from normal Celery tasks, which was bad.
Basically, if you used to have::

    MyTask().delay_or_fail()

now you'll have::

    MyTask.delay_or_fail()

0.1.1
-----

* Memory leak detection via ``memleak_threshold``
* Tox and Travis-CI tests!

0.1.0
-----

* A super sweet name. Much better than AwesomeResultTask.
* This changelog
* Hope?
