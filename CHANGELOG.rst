Changelog
=========

0.2.0
-----

* We're now overriding the base `Task.async_result` call, instead of the
  `Task.delay` call. This means that if you need to customize some of the
  options only available via `async_result`, you don't lose any of the
  Jobtastic functionality.
* `delay_or_fail` should now consistently detect all types of broker failures,
  regardless of your broker choice.
* `delay_or_eager` is here to replace `delay_or_run`! This applies your tasks
  the same way that Celery does when `CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER` is configured,
  giving you more consistency. The biggest benefit, though, is that you always
  get a result that behaves like an `AsyncResult` object, meaning you don't
  have to fuss with the `was_fallback` variable. `delay_or_run` is still
  around, but it's deprecated. It will go away with the `0.3.0` release.
* Bug fix: `delay_or_fail` actually works during the failure case, now.
  And we have tests on it so that it will keep working.
* `delay_or_fail` now properly sets the traceback for inspection via
  `get_traceback`.
